# Immigrid

## Summary

This project was meant to be an iOS and Android app for immigrants to the US to find a group with common intrests and culture.
We also planned on adding features to help immigrants obtain legal documentation, which can be extremely difficult to obtain especially for someone who is unfamiliar with American laws.

## Design

When entering the app the user may sign in or create an account. 
Then the user may choose to find fellow immigrant groups, or
they can choose to use our guide on how to obtain legal documentation.

## Presenting this project

At the end of the semester (December 2022), our group came together and pitched this idea to a council of tech professionals.
Representatives included the CEO of the Nashville Tech Council, and a Software Developer from the Tennessee Titans.

## Potential Problems

We would need to obtain funding to host data about groups and chat logs if those are implemented to ensure auditability.
Also Immigrants would need to organize groups together and if we do not market it properly, then groups wont be formed on the app,
and potential users may join only to see that nobody they can relate to is on the app.

## Why we ended work on this project

My team and I stopped working on this project due to the fact that we could not meet in person anymore due to graduation,
and we could not continue due to differing priorities.
